    Simple blackjack environment

    Blackjack is a card game where the goal is to obtain cards that sum to as
    near as possible to 21 without going over.  They're playing against a fixed
    dealer.
    Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) have point value 10.
    Aces can either count as 11 or 1, and it's called 'usable' at 11.
    This game is placed with an infinite deck (or with replacement).
    The game starts with each (player and dealer) having one face up and one
    face down card.

    The player can request additional cards (hit=1) until they decide to stop
    (stick=0) or exceed 21 (bust).

    After the player sticks, the dealer reveals their facedown card, and draws
    until their sum is 17 or greater.  If the dealer goes bust the player wins.

    If neither player nor dealer busts, the outcome (win, lose, draw) is
    decided by whose sum is closer to 21.  The reward for winning is +1,
    drawing is 0, and losing is -1.

    The observation of a 3-tuple of: the players current sum,
    the dealer's one showing card (1-10 where 1 is ace),
    and whether or not the player holds a usable ace (0 or 1).

    This environment corresponds to the version of the blackjack problem
    described in Example 5.1 in Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction
    by Sutton and Barto (1998).

#### Target :
Training an RL agent to solve the above MDP while maximizing the reward.

#### Algorithm Class :
Monte Carlo

#### Key Fundamentals Implemented :
- MC Prediction: State Values
- MC Prediction: Action Values
- Generalized Policy Iteration
- MC Control: Incremental Mean
- MC Control: Policy Evaluation
- MC Control: Policy Improvement
- MC Control: GLIE
- MC Control: Constant- Î±

#### Final Result :
- Initial State Value Function  :<br>

- Final State Value Function :<br>

- Known Optimal Policy :<br>![Known Optimal Policy](resources/known_optimal_policy.png)

- Achieved Final Policy :<br>![Achieved Final Policy](resources/final_policy.png)

**As clear from the above results , the State Value Function is now maximized & the achieved policy is much similar to the known optimal policy. Hence the RL agent is fairly able to solve the MDP**
